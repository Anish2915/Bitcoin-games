## Introduction

### The Problem

In the current fast-paced environment, having access to timely and accurate information is essential. However, the market for news and inside information often faces issues such as misinformation, lack of transparency, and difficulties in verifying the credibility of sources. Traditional platforms do not offer a reliable mechanism for ensuring the accuracy and authenticity of the information being traded.

Additionally, individuals with valuable information lack means to monetize it. Why share important news or information for free?

### The Solution

Chain Sphere addresses these challenges by creating a decentralized marketplace where users can securely trade news and inside information. By leveraging Web 3 technologies, we ensure that transactions are transparent, secure, and immutable. Our platform incorporates user ratings and AI verification to maintain a high standard of information accuracy and credibility.

### How We Are Solving It

1. **Decentralized Platform**: Utilizing MetaMask and Rootstock for secure, decentralized transactions ensures user privacy and data security.
2. **Smart Contracts**: Employing smart contracts through Rootstock enables automated and trustless transactions.
3. **Cryptocurrency Integration**: Incorporating the Rootstock API for cryptocurrency exchange supports a wide range of digital assets, making transactions seamless.
4. **User and AI Ratings**: Implementing a dual-rating system where buyers rate the sellers and AI evaluates the correctness of the information ensures a trustworthy marketplace.

## Features

- **Web 3 Technology Integration**: Utilizes MetaMask for secure, decentralized transactions, ensuring user privacy and data security.
- **Rootstock Integration**: Employs Rootstock for smart contracts, enabling automated and trustless transactions.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**: Users sign up and create an account, connecting their MetaMask wallet for transactions.
2. **Information Listing**: Sellers list their news or inside information for sale, setting a price in cryptocurrency.
3. **Buying Information**: Buyers browse the marketplace, purchase information, and pay using their connected MetaMask wallet.
4. **Rating System**: After reviewing the information, buyers rate the seller based on accuracy and usefulness. AI also rates the information's accuracy, ensuring a robust verification system.
